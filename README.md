The CETyourfuture project aims to streamline the MHT CET admission process
by providing an all-in-one, web-based platform that assists prospective students
with essential admission-related services. Through a user-friendly interface,
students can access crucial features like a document upload system, a chatbot for
instant doubt clearance, personalized college recommendations, and a steps and
schedule page displaying the key stages of the admission process. The platform
addresses the current lack of real-time support and the overwhelming
requirements associated with the admission journey, enabling students to
confidently navigate each step with clarity. The integration of MongoDB ensures
efficient data management for user profiles, admission data, and chat logs, while
Flask handles backend processes, including authentication, document
management, and chatbot interactions. With the help of Google Drive integration,
students can securely store and retrieve important documents, enhancing
accessibility and security throughout the process.
